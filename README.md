# athletic_sales_analysis
Module 5 Challenge focuses on data combining using concatenation, joins, merging, and reshaping. 

This entails importing two athletic sales data sets from CSV files into one DataFrame through an inner join and resetting the index.

Using groupby or pivot table function, a multi index DataFrame is created to aggregate region, state, city level sales of various athletic product sales.

Sales data is further analyzed through a pivot table to determine the retailer who sold the most women’s athletic footwear, the day and the week the most women’s athletic footwear was sold.
